# interprocess-traits

The interprocess-traits crate is built to aid safe APIs that involve interprocess communication and
memory sharing. The provided traits `ProcSend` and `ProcSync` closely mirror the standard `Send`
and `Sync` marker traits and are intended to be implemented by types that are intended to be usable
between distinct processes.
